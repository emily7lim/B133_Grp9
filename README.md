## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on songs from 3 datasets merged.

1. This data is obtained from [The Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) 

2. This dataset consists of [lyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilnayak123/5-million-song-lyrics-dataset) from kaggle dataset. 

3. This dataset consist of [popular songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts) which were in viral50 and top200.
